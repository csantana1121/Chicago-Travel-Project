            Hey all! This is just a quick Rough draft of what our Page might have.
        </p>

    <br />

        <p>
            List of different pages at the top of the page: <br />
            Home <br />
            Activities <br />
            Food <br />

                Home
            </d1>
            <br />
            The Home page can have a large button for the quiz. It can say something like **** Quiz ****
            <br />
            A quick explanation under the button like **** take a quiz to plan your perfect adventure in americas windy city! ****
            <br />
            the page will keep scrolling down to then give a more comprehensive explanation on how to use the site and the different tabs.
            <br />
            should have a lot of photos to make the site less wordy and fun on the first page.
        </p>
